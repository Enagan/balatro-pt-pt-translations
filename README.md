# Balatro Portuguese Translation

A WIP European Portuguese version of the fantastic french balatro translation mod [balatro-french-translations](https://github.com/FrBmt-BIGetNouf/balatro-french-translations).

The point of doing this is because the existing portuguese translation is awful, including upside down sentences and inconsistent game terms.

But also because due to the nature of the theme of the game, there is significant difference from brazilian portuguese and european portuguese in regards to poker and card game terms in general.


## Current state

Translations have started!
